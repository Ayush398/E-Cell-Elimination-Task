        The Indian Air Force (IAF) is the air arm of the Indian Armed Forces. Its complement of personnel and aircraft
        assets ranks fourth amongst the air forces of the world. Its primary mission is to secure Indian airspace
        and to conduct aerial warfare during armed conflict. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an
        auxiliary air force of the British Empire which honoured India's aviation service during World War II with the
        prefix Royal. After India gained independence from United Kingdom in 1947, the name Royal Indian Air Force
        was kept and served in the name of Dominion of India. With the government's transition to a Republic in 1950,
        the prefix Royal was removed.
        <br><br>
        Since 1950, the IAF has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan. Other major operations undertaken
        by the IAF include Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot, Operation Cactus and Operation Poomalai. The IAF's
        mission expands beyond engagement with hostile forces, with the IAF participating in United Nations peacekeeping
        missions.
        <br><br>
        The President of India holds the rank of Supreme Commander of the IAF. As of 1 July 2017, 1,39,576 personnel
        are in service with the Indian Air Force. The Chief of the Air Staff, an air chief marshal, is a
        four-star officer and is responsible for the bulk of operational command of the Air Force. There is never more
        than one serving ACM at any given time in the IAF. The rank of Marshal of the Air Force has been conferred by
        the President of India on one occasion in history, to Arjan Singh. On 26 January 2002, Singh became the first
        and so far, only five-star rank officer of the IAF.
