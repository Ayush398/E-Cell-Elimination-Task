    <p style="font-size: 19px;">

        <br><br>
        The principal task of the Defence Ministry is to obtain policy directions of the Government on all defence and
        security related matters and communicate them for implementation to the Services Headquarters, Inter-Services
        Organisations, Production Establishments and Research and Development Organisations. It is also required to

    <h2 style="color: sandybrown;" id="Historical Background">Historical Background</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 19px;">
        A Military Department was created in the Supreme Government of the East India Company at Kolkata into the year
        1776, having the main function to sift and record orders relating to the Army issued by various Departments of
        the Govt of East India Co. The Military Department initially functioned as a branch of the Public Department and
        maintained a list of Army personnel.
        <br> <br>
        With the Charter Act of 1833, the Secretariat of the Government of East India Company was reorganised into four
        Departments, including a Military Department, each headed by a Secretary to the Government. The Army in the
        Presidencies of Bengal, Bombay & Madras functioned as respective Presidency Army till April 1895, when the
        Presidency Armies were unified into a single Indian Army. For administrative convenience, it was divided into
        four Commands viz. Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal, Madras (including Burma) and Bombay
        (including Sind, Quetta and Aden).
        <br> <br>
        The supreme authority over the Indian Army vested in the Governor General-in-Council, subject to the Control of
        the Crown, which was exercised by the Secretary of State for India. Two Members in the Council were responsible
        for military affairs, one of whom was the Military Member, who supervised all administrative and financial
        matters, while the other was the Commander-in-Chief who was responsible for all operational matters. The
        Military Department was abolished in March 1906 and it was replaced by two separate Departments, the Army
        Department and the Military Supply Department. In April 1909, the Military Supply Department was abolished and
        its functions were taken over by the Army Department. The Army Department was redesignated as the Defence
        Department in January, 1938. The Department of Defence became the Ministry of Defence under a Cabinet Minister
        in August, 1947.

    <p style="font-size: 19px;">
        After independence, Ministry of Defence was created under the charge of a Cabinet Minister, and, each Service
        was placed under its own Commander-in-Chief. In 1955, the Commanders-in-Chief were renamed as the Chief of the
        Army Staff, the Chief of the Naval Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff. In November 1962, a Department of
        Defence Production was set up to deal with research, development and production of defence equipment. In
        November 1965, the Department of Defence Supplies was created for planning and execution of schemes for import
        substitution of defence requirements. These two Departments were later merged to form the Department of Defence
        Production and Supplies. In 2004, the name of Department of Defence Production and Supplies was changed to
        Department of Defence Production. In 1980, the Department of Defence Research and Development was created. In
        2004, the Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare was created. The Department of Military Affairs with Chief of
        Defence Staff (CDS) as its ex-officio Secretary was created in December, 2019 to facilitate optimal utilization
        of resources and promote jointness among the three Services..
        <br><br>
        The Defence Secretary functions as head of the Department of Defence and is additionally responsible for
        co-ordinating the activities of the five Departments in the Ministry.
